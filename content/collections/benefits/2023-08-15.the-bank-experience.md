Our ‘Being Humber’ guide sets out the values and behaviours we should all expect from one another in a simple framework for us all to use. A positive way of doing things and how we interact with others can positively impact how any of us feel during a working day. It can also have a positive impact outside of work as we can often take those good feelings home with us, how we feel about our work and our relationships with those we work with. Therefore we are proud to offer our bank workers a positive 'Being Humber' experience. "
