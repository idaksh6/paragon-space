I was keen to take up the chance to receive a Health MOT from our Health and Wellbeing Team. It is so important to be aware of all aspects of your health and to be mindful of your general physical and mental wellbeing. I would encourage all who are able to take part in this great initiative, and to be aware of the other help offered by our Health and Wellbeing Team, such as support to access health and wellbeing apps, tools, and resources
